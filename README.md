## ClearVoice Frontend Onsite Project

### Overview
Create a list of author items that match the provided comp. CSS/styling should only be started after the correct information is in place.

#### Directions
1. Load the authors and the books from the provided API endpoint
  - The API was designed poorly and does not provide any filters or expansion. You must load up all of the records and match on `author_id` 
2. Construct and append the necessary DOM
  - The DOM structure can be changed up later once you begin to style the items
3. Style the items

### Yarn scripts
#### Start the API Server
```
yarn api
```

#### Start the Webpack Server
```
yarn dev
```

#### To start both servers together
```
yarn start
```
